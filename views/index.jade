            h2 About me
            p I am a forward-thinking UX designer and researcher with a strong background in interaction design, qualitative research, computer science, and project management. I have a passion for technology, and for building meaningful and innovative products that improve the ways that we work, learn, and live.
            p I currently work at Microsoft where I design and build inclusive and accessible experiences across the Microsoft Office suite. I am also working on my Masterâ€™s degree in Human Centered Design & Engineering at the University of Washington. Combining my experiences from academic research and industry design, I am able to bring a unique perspective to each group that I work with, bringing to light new opportunities for innovation and collaboration.
